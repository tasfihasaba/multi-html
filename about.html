<h2>My Philosophy of what it means to be an engineer:<br></h2>
<p>To be an engineer, we have to know that everything in the real world is based on math and mechanics. I think engineers agree that they can understand and model our world by using the tools of quantitative analysis. They look at how science and engineering relate to each other and how the progress in one field affects the progress in the other. 
    Engineers may be most aware of their ability to solve important global problems with energy, sustainability, transportation, education, health care, food, and the environment. Engineers want to make a better world for everyone in the long run.</p>
